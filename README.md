This project was created for the capstone project at the end of Google's data analytics certificate course.

The idea behind the project is as follows: a bike-share company interested is in maximizing the number of riders signing up for their annual membership. In order to do so they must analyze trends between the behavior of riders who are annual members and those who are not, in order to devise strategies aimed at converting more non-members into members.

The raw data comes from spreadsheets made public by Divvy, chronicling rider behavior for each month of the year 2022.

For the project, after cleaning each spreadsheet in Excel, the data was imported into Microsoft SQL Server, where all the data was combined into one yearly table.

Summary statistics and tables were selected from the yearly data in order to analyze the relationships between select variables as well as ride trends. Charts for these tables were then created using Tableau.

The powerpoint combines all the relevant charts together, as well as describes the business task, data cleaning steps, and recommendations based on the data.
